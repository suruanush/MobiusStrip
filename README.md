MobiusStrip
A Möbius strip is a fascinating 1-sided, 1-edged surface with no orientation—traverse its length, and you’ll return flipped!

Key Features
✔ One-Sided Magic – No "inside" or "outside"; just a single continuous surface.
✔ Half-Twist Creation – Twist a paper strip 180° and tape its ends.
✔ Math & Engineering – Used in conveyor belts, resistors, and topology studies.

A paradox in paper form—where beginnings and endings merge infinitely.
